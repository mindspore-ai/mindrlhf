        "answer": " Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine how many toys each rabbit will have after Junior buys all the toys and splits them evenly.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of toys bought on each day:**\n   - On Monday, Junior bought 6 toys.\n   - On Wednesday, Junior bought twice as many toys as on Monday, so he bought \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) toys.\n   - On Friday, Junior bought four times as many toys as on Monday, so he bought \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) toys.\n   - On the next day (Saturday), Junior bought half as many toys as on Wednesday, so he bought \\(\\frac{12}{2} = 6\\) toys.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of toys bought:**\n   - Total toys = Toys on Monday + Toys on Wednesday + Toys on Friday + Toys on Saturday\n   - Total toys = \\(6 + 12 + 24 + 6 = 48\\)\n\n3. **Split the toys evenly among the rabbits:**\n   - Junior has 16 rabbits, so each rabbit will get \\(\\frac{48}{16} = 3\\) toys.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Number of toys bought on each day\ntoys_monday = 6\ntoys_wednesday = 2 * toys_monday\ntoys_friday = 4 * toys_monday\ntoys_saturday = toys_wednesday / 2\n\n# Total number of toys\ntotal_toys = toys_monday + toys_wednesday + toys_friday + toys_saturday\n\n# Number of rabbits\nnum_rabbits = 16\n\n# Toys per rabbit\ntoys_per_rabbit = total_toys / num_rabbits\nprint(toys_per_rabbit)\n```\n```output\n3.0\n```\nThe calculation confirms that each rabbit will have \\(\\boxed{3}\\) toys.",

        "answer": " To determine the total number of animals for sale in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of each type of animal and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Number of dogs**: The pet store has 6 dogs.\n2. **Number of cats**: The number of cats is half the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n3. **Number of birds**: The number of birds is twice the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of birds is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n4. **Number of fish**: The number of fish is three times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of fish is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of each type of animal to find the total number of animals for sale:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ (dogs)} + 3 \\text{ (cats)} + 12 \\text{ (birds)} + 18 \\text{ (fish)} = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals for sale in the pet store is \\(\\boxed{39}\\).",

Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?",
